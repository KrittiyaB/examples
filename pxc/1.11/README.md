# How to use PXC with DC/OS

## Prerequisites

* A running DC/OS 1.11 cluster

## Install

Before starting with installation of PXC, we need to install the kafka-zookeeper service on the same DC/OS cluster. Please refer kafka-zookeeper service docs as installation guide.

For a basic kafka-zookeeper install from command line we need to use the following command:

```bash
dcos package install kafka-zookeeper
```

and via DC/OS UI, kafka-zookeeper can be installed as shown below:

![Kafka-Zookeeper Install](img/kafka-zookeeper-ui-install.png)

PXC can be installed via either the DC/OS Catalog UI or by using the CLI. The following command will launch the install via the DC/OS CLI:

```bash
dcos package install pxc
```

![PXC Install](img/pxc_install.png)

In either case a default cluster will come up with three PXC nodes and one ProxySQL node on the public DC/OS cluster node. 

It is recommended to have nodes in odd number count for PXC to avoid condition of split brain.


## Accessing the Console

Once the cluster is up and running, we need to have a mysql client version 5.7 on our local system to connect to the pxc cluster.

We also need to find out Public facing DC/OS cluster hostname/IP for connecting from the mysql client.

In our case since our DC/OS cluster is deployed on AWS infrastructure, we need to get the EC2 instance in the DC/OS cluster which is part of the "PublicSlaveSecurityGroup"

Hence we us the following command using mysql client to connect to the PXC cluster on DC/OS :

```bash
root@bf7132b3a085:/# mysql -uproxysql_user -ppassw0rd -h 18.179.47.46 -P 3306
mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.

mysql> 

```

Now we can check the pxc cluster values using the following command:

```bash

mysql> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
+--------------------+
1 row in set (0.12 sec)

mysql> select 1;
+---+
| 1 |
+---+
| 1 |
+---+
1 row in set (0.14 sec)


```



Now we need to add more query rules in the proxysql service by connecting to it by referring to https://github.com/sysown/proxysql/wiki/ProxySQL-Configuration.  

We will also need to get the proxysql endpoint hostname for connecting to it from the task using the below command:

```bash
dcos pxc endpoints lb-port
```

To connect to the proxysql service running on the cluster, we need to get the  task id for proxysql service using the below command.

```bash
$ dcos task
```
Then we need to get into the proxysql task by assigning bash shell to it in the following way

```bash
dcos task exec -ti proxysql-0-proxysql-task__cc6eb6cd-054e-460f-9a9b-842bda3930a4 bash
```

From the proxysql task we need to connect to the proxysql service using the below command:

```bash
mysql -uradminuser -pradminpass -h proxysql-0-proxysql-task.pxc.autoip.dcos.thisdcos.directory -P 6032
mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.

```
Now we can setup query rules following the above mentioned link for proxysql configuration.



## Adding Nodes

Letâ€™s say we have two data nodes, and we want to go to three.

![Couchbase Data Nodes](img/couch_dnodes.png)

You need to go and edit the configuration of your couchbase service, and increase the data node count to 3.
